👋 Hello, I’m @MartinWood66
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things to list here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basically anything I can.  Python, Java, Java Script, VBA/VB, React...
- 💞️ At this point, I’m not sure if I am looking to collaborate on anything, but who knows?  If you have something interesting and I can help, I might.
- 📫 How to reach me: 66Thor@comcast.net
